## IS 3300: Data-Driven Web Applications

The following was a self-directed project to explore dynamic/interactive web site applications.

Orbit Simulation:
- Built via HTML canvas
- Largely based on Brian Cruz's [gravity simulation](http://justfound.co/gravity/)

Interactive Scatter:
- Built via D3js
- Data cleaned manually after being sourced from a public database
